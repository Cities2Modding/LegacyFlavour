# LegacyFlavour Mod for Cities Skylines 2

Welcome to the GitHub repository for LegacyFlavour, a Cities Skylines 2 mod designed to blend the best of Cities Skylines 1 with the advanced features of Cities Skylines 2. Our mod aims to enhance your city-building experience by introducing nostalgic elements and improved functionalities.

## Features

LegacyFlavour currently includes the following features:

1. **Unit Display for Road Tools**: This feature introduces a 'Unit' display for road tools, making it easier to plan and build your roads with precision. (Note: This feature requires the unit type to be set to Imperial in the game options.)

2. **Transparent Zone Grid Cells**: We've made zone grid cells transparent for a cleaner, more visually appealing city layout, allowing for a more immersive city planning experience.

3. **Re-worked color Zone colour scheme**: Changes the colour scheme of zones to better match Cities Skylines 1. (UI icons will be updated too in the near future).

4. **Color-Blindness Modes**: This is WIP and currently in testing. Cycle zone colours to match a scheme for specific types of colour blindness.

5. **Toggle Shortcuts**: 

- ALT+Z to toggle the zone colours mod. 
- SHIFT+Z to cycle through colour blindness modes.
- ALT+S to toggle Sticky Infomode Whiteness. 
- SHIFT+W to toggle Sticky Infomode Whiteness value override.
- ALT+R to reload the config file
- ALT+U to toggle Units display

6. **Configure Zone colours via JSON**: Config file in mod directory to allow custom values.

7. **Dynamic Zone Borders**: If it snows zone borders will switch colour to be more visible on snow. **UPDATE** this now calculates snow coverage so is more accurate. It may have a delay as updates occur periodically to prevent performance hits.

8. **Dynamic UI Icons**: UI icons for zones now adapt to match the configured colours. These are dynamically generated from the games icons based on config settings.

9. **Sticky Infomode Whiteness**: Shortcuts to override infomode 'whiteness' setting to stop it constantly popping up.
