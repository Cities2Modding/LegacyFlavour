## Features

LegacyFlavour currently includes the following features:

1. **Unit Display for Road Tools**: This feature introduces a 'Unit' display for road tools, making it easier to plan and build your roads with precision. (Note: This feature requires the unit type to be set to Imperial in the game options.)

2. **Transparent Zone Grid Cells**: We've made zone grid cells transparent for a cleaner, more visually appealing city layout, allowing for a more immersive city planning experience.

3. **Re-worked colour Zone colour scheme**: Changes the colour scheme of zones to better match Cities Skylines 1. (UI icons will be updated too in the near future).

4. **Colour-Blindness Modes**: This is WIP and currently in testing. Cycle zone colours to match a scheme for specific types of colour blindness.

5. **Toggle Shortcuts**: 

- ALT+Z to toggle the zone colours mod. 
- SHIFT+Z to cycle through colour blindness modes.
- ALT+S to toggle Sticky Infomode Whiteness. 
- SHIFT+W to toggle Sticky Infomode Whiteness value override.
- ALT+R to reload the config file
- ALT+U to toggle Units display

6. **Configure Zone colours via JSON**: Config file in mod directory to allow custom values.

7. **Dynamic Zone Borders**: If it snows zone borders will switch colour to be more visible on snow. **UPDATE** this now calculates snow coverage so is more accurate. It may have a delay as updates occur periodically to prevent performance hits.

8. **Dynamic UI Icons**: UI icons for zones now adapt to match the configured colours. These are dynamically generated from the games icons based on config settings.

9. **Sticky Infomode Whiteness**: Shortcuts to override infomode 'whiteness' setting to stop it constantly popping up.

10. **UI System via HookUI**: Integrates with [HookUI](https://github.com/Captain-Of-Coit/hookui/releases) to offer an advanced UI system, elevating your control and customization options.

11. **Configurable Zoning Configuration**: Customize zoning options like never before. Adjust colours, borders, and more, directly from the UI.

12. **Enhanced Control over Weather and Time**: Control weather and time settings with new features, including saving these states between game reloads.

13. **Easy UI Access**: Access the new UI menu conveniently through the HookUI button located in the top left corner.

14. **Live UI Configurations**: Experience live changes in the game as you adjust settings. Utilize colour pickers and other interactive elements for an immersive configuration process.

15. **Buttons, buttons!**: You can set colour blindness profile sets to the vanilla colours, reset them to Legacy Flavour's default.
